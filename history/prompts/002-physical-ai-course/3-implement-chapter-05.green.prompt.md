# Learning and Adaptation Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented Chapter 05: Learning and Adaptation for the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Course. The implementation includes comprehensive content, a subchapter, and a GitHub-stored training scripts-based reproducibility checkpoint.

## Prompt Text

```
now write down chapter 05 which enhance physical ai and humanoid robotics course in advance level and add one subchapter
```

## Response Text

Successfully implemented Chapter 05: Learning and Adaptation with:
- Main chapter file (index.md) with over 2000 words covering foundations of learning in physical systems, reinforcement learning, imitation learning, adaptive control, multi-modal learning, human-robot interaction, learning in uncertain environments, meta-learning, and learning from human feedback
- One subchapter file (300-400 words) on: Reinforcement Learning for Physical AI
- Proper integration with Docusaurus documentation system through sidebar configuration
- Comprehensive reproducibility checkpoint with GitHub-stored training scripts including environments, algorithms, configurations, and tutorials
- Example PPO implementation, validation scripts, and documentation
- All required documentation and setup files for the reproducibility checkpoint
