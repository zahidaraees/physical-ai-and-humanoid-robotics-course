# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

Welcome to the complete course on creating AI systems that function in the real world and comprehend physical laws through embodied intelligence.

## About This Book

This comprehensive resource explores Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. You'll learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## What You'll Learn

- **Physical AI Fundamentals**: Understanding embodied intelligence and AI systems in the physical world
- **ROS 2 Robotics**: Creating the robotic nervous system with nodes, topics, and services
- **Digital Twins**: Simulation environments with Gazebo and Unity for physics simulation
- **Advanced Perception**: Using NVIDIA Isaac for synthetic data generation and hardware-accelerated processing
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Integrating vision, language, and action systems for autonomous behavior
